## Personal vs. Enterprise?

- To update your servers from a t3.micro to c4.large, check out [Updating the Stack](./hubs-cloud-aws-updating-the-stack.md)
- Personal has defaults that are lower cost. Enterprise defaults are higher cost but improve site functionality like no database pausing.
- Enterprise allows multiple servers. If one goes down unexpectantly, the others will take over. Personal only allows one server.
- Both beyond that they are the same in the options they offer and Personal can be configured to be an expensive, highly scalable single server, and vice versa.
- The pricing is the same
